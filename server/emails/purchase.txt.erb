Hi,

  Thank you for purchasing Master Hotwire book beta version.

  Your copy of the book is attached to this email.

  You have purchased a beta version which currently exists in the PDF format. The rest of the content as well as a web version is in the works and an epub version is planned for the future. You will receive all of the additional versions and updates as they are made.

  I can't make any promises regarding the timeline but finishing this book is my primary focus, in addition to my day job.

  If you are interested in getting early access to Part II about Hotwire Native, you can join the beta reading group. Just reply to this e-mail and let me know.

  In the meantime I hope you enjoy the book! And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

Best,
Radan
