Hi,

  Thank you so much for purchasing Master Hotwire book beta version and supporting my work!

  Your copy of the book is attached to this email.

  You have purchased a beta version which currently exists in the PDF format. The final part of the book as well as a web version is in the works and an epub version is planned for the future. You will receive all of the additional versions and updates as they are made.

  The book is mostly finished, only the final section is still in progress. I can't make any promises regarding the timeline but finishing this book is my primary focus, in addition to my day job.

  In the meantime I hope you enjoy the book! And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

Best,
Radan
