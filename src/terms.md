# Terms of Service

## TL:DR;

After purchasing the book you can use it for your own personal use.

You are not allowed to share or resell it.

If you don't like it for whatever reason, you can get a full refund within 30 days of purchase. The only requirement is sharing your reason, any reason, for requesting the refund.
