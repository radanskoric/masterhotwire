    This year I've learnt a lot about Hotwire, and my favourite resources for that, besides reading the source code of the various libraries, have been Radan's Master Hotwire book, and
    Joe Masilotti's Hotwire Native book! really recommend both!

    I bought an early version at the end of 2024 and learned a lot even then. Have recommended many times and will continue to do so. The way you break down the topics is quite unique and really resonates.

    I think RadanSkoric's subchapter about the "significance of progressive enhancement for HTML-over-the-wire" from his excellent "Master Hotwire" ebook is what finally helped me build the correct mental model.

    It's a short one, but a huge "a-ha!" moment for me.

    Even in the age of vibe coding, this book is an essential, no‑nonsense guide for anyone seriously building Hotwire powered Rails applications.
    Radan has a rare talent for explaining complex concepts with clarity and depth, so you walk away with a deep understanding of how the whole stack fits together.

    Right from the outset, this book is very clear about its objectives and its audience. Radan's writing is engaging and entertaining, precisely detailed and comprehensive.

    If you're an experienced Rails developer and want to really understand Hotwire, this book is for you. Part I easily stands alone; Parts II and III are eagerly anticipated!

    Having worked alongside Radan for many years, I can vouch that this book is exactly what you'd expect from him - breaking down Turbo Drive, Frames, Streams, and all that Hotwire goodness in that annoyingly clear way he does. I've been using the Hotwire stack since its release, yet I still learned a ton of new insights and practical approaches.

    As a Rails developer who had some Hotwire experience but is definitely
    not an expert, I've enjoyed this book's thorough guide through the
    Hotwire universe – it helps with an overarching understanding, something
    that the official docs alone could not achieve for me. It also explains
    in detail how some parts actually work under the hood and provides links
    to the relevant locations on GitHub – very helpful for a deeper
    understanding.

    This book is an excellent companion for implementing real-world applications with Hotwire. Unlike many entry-level tutorials that quickly jump into "draw the rest of the owl" territory, Radan guides us through incrementally more complex problems, demonstrating how to tackle them with great pedagogy. As a bonus, each step includes a detailed paragraph explaining the framework's internals and why everything works as it does. I highly recommend Master Hotwire to any Ruby on Rails developer looking to enhance their application with Hotwire.

    I struggled to find current and reliable tutorials on Hotwire, and this book was exactly what I needed. The practical tips and hands-on approach helped me overcome my biggest development hurdles. Highly recommended for anyone looking to supercharge their Hotwire skills.

    I love how the book doesn't just explain what Hotwire can do.
    It keeps you engaged by laying out the problem first and then showing how Hotwire solves it.
    On top of that, the “under the hood” sections scratch my developer itch by showing the actual implementation details along with source code links.

    As a seasoned Rails developer, who was absent from the Rails world the past ~6 years, it’s a terrific resource that helped me get started.
