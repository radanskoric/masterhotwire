    Right from the outset, this book is very clear about its objectives and its audience. Radan's writing is engaging and entertaining, precisely detailed and comprehensive.

    If you're an experienced Rails developer and want to really understand Hotwire, this book is for you. Part I easily stands alone; Parts II and III are eagerly anticipated!

    Having worked alongside Radan for many years, I can vouch that this book is exactly what you'd expect from him - breaking down Turbo Drive, Frames, Streams, and all that Hotwire goodness in that annoyingly clear way he does. I've been using the Hotwire stack since its release, yet I still learned a ton of new insights and practical approaches.

    As a Rails developer who had some Hotwire experience but is definitely
    not an expert, I've enjoyed this book's thorough guide through the
    Hotwire universe – it helps with an overarching understanding, something
    that the official docs alone could not achieve for me. It also explains
    in detail how some parts actually work under the hood and provides links
    to the relevant locations on GitHub – very helpful for a deeper
    understanding.

    This book is an excellent companion for implementing real-world applications with Hotwire. Unlike many entry-level tutorials that quickly jump into "draw the rest of the owl" territory, Radan guides us through incrementally more complex problems, demonstrating how to tackle them with great pedagogy. As a bonus, each step includes a detailed paragraph explaining the framework's internals and why everything works as it does. I highly recommend Master Hotwire to any Ruby on Rails developer looking to enhance their application with Hotwire.

    As a seasoned Rails developer, who was absent from the Rails world the past ~6 years, it’s a terrific resource that helped me get started.
