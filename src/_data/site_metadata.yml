  "Master Hotwire" is structured to help you build a strong mental model of Hotwire. It combines explanations of functionality with hands-on coding. The book guides you through building a collaborative Kanban board in such a way that you immediately use every new concept you learn. And by targeting experienced developers I was able to make it short, so you can finish it quickly. It is the fastest way for experienced developers to learn Hotwire.
